# Hotlist Snapshots
A repository for hourly snapshots of the KA hot list.

Inspired by MrMagma's similar [project](https://github.com/MrMagma/KA-Hotlist-Data), which was updated for a bit, then shut down.

This also should record snapshots every two hours, instead of every day.

Ideally, in order to get a good sample size, I would run this for around four months before trying to analyse the data. We'll see how that goes.
